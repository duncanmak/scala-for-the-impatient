The java.awt.Rectangle class has useful methods 'translate' and 'grow'
that are unfortunately absent from classes such as
java.awt.geom.Ellipse2D.Double. In Scala, you can fix this
problem. Define a trait 'RectangleLike' with concrete methods
'translate' and 'grow'. Provided any abstract methods that you need
for the implementation, so that you can mix in thet trait like this:

val egg = new java.awt.geom.Ellipse2D.Double (5, 10, 20, 30) with RectangleLike

egg.translate (10, -10)
egg.grow (10, 20)
